## Introduction

Random Number Sorter is a user-friendly application that provides an intuitive interface for sorting random numbers. The program leverages the power of Java Swing to create an interactive GUI that allows users to perform the following tasks:

- Generate random numbers
- Add the generated numbers to a list
- Select a sorting algorithm
- Sort the numbers in ascending order
- View the sorted numbers

This application is designed to provide a visual representation of sorting algorithms and help users understand their performance characteristics.

## Features

- Random number generation: Users can generate a specified number of random integers.
- Add to list: Users can add the generated numbers to a list for sorting.
- Sorting algorithms: The program offers a selection of sorting algorithms to choose from, such as bubble sort, insertion sort, and quicksort.
- Sort the numbers: Users can initiate the sorting process by selecting the desired sorting algorithm.
- View sorted numbers: The sorted numbers are displayed in ascending order for easy visualization.

## Getting Started

To get started with Random Number Sorter, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the source code as a ZIP file.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
3. Build and run the application.
4. The GUI will appear, allowing you to generate random numbers, add them to the list, and perform sorting operations.

## Usage

1. **Generate Random Numbers**: Enter the desired number of random numbers you want to generate and click the "Generate" button. The randomly generated numbers will be displayed in the application.
2. **Add Numbers to List**: Click the "Add to List" button to add the generated numbers to the list for sorting.
3. **Select Sorting Algorithm**: Choose the desired sorting algorithm from the available options provided on the left side of the GUI.
4. **Sort Numbers**: Click the "Sort" button to initiate the sorting process using the selected algorithm. The numbers will be sorted in ascending order.
5. **View Sorted Numbers**: The sorted numbers will be displayed in ascending order on the screen, providing a visual representation of the sorted list.
